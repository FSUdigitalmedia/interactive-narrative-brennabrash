You've never had a more self conscious walk from the bus to your locker.
Yet when you think about how cute the shoes are, you get a little extra pep in your step.

"Ummmmmmm hello gorgeous!," calls you your best friend. 
"What is going on with you, did your mom finally cave and buy something from that shop at the mall? You look so stunning!!"

[[accept the compliment|accept]] [[shy away|shy]]

Ahhh thank you, aren't the shoes adorable! But you wont believe how I got them...

Before you can reaccount the bizzar events of this morning, the first period bell rings and [[everyone scatters|first period]].

You gained one confidence point!

"Ugh, I don't know, I feel so silly!"

You fumble around with the lock on your locker. 

"Maybe I should change into that extra outfit I keep in here..."

But before you can get it open, the first period bell rings and [[everyone scatters|first period]].
