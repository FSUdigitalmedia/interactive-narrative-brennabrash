"Hi! My name is , nice to meet you!

You jump a little. 
Whenever they add voices to the characters it's so creepy.

"I am here to unlock your inner fashionista! What path would you like to choose?""

Player picks from these options:
Mall Goth
Cottage Core
Preppy

Shows outfit we pick, it's on the tame side
 
 They have so many crazy options in this game! But I like this.

You go to click the [[finish button]]

:: finish button
"WHAAATTTT! Common girl you can do better than that!!""

Huh?? 
You’ve never had a game talk back to you before. 

"Uhhhh isn’t the whole point that I get to choose?"

Wrong!! It's my outfit, I'm allowed to give you input!

WHOA, did the game… just hear me??
 
"Hellooooooo! I don’t have all day! 
This button up you chose is such a snoozefest, I want something with more... pizzazz!!"

"Uhhhh…. Ok."

Player picks [[new outfit]]

:: new outfit
"Oh you're right, I think this looks much cuter on you!"

"See, sometimes you gotta say fuck it and wear what you wanna wear girl!"

Are they allowed to put F bombs in a game like this, isn’t it for kids?

"Ugh you're right. I never push myself outside my comfort zone. I wish I could pull off an  outfit like you."

Her unblinking eyes stare back at you.

[[Time for bed!|morningone]]
