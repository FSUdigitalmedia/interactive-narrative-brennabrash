You start that familiar school day all over again...
<</if>>
<<timed 0.5s t8n>> You've never had a more self conscious walk from the bus to your locker.
<<next 2s t8n>> Yet when you think about how cute your new shoes are, you get a little @@color:magenta;extra pep in your step@@.

<<next 2s t8n>>"@@color:magenta;Ummmmmmm hello gorgeous!@@," calls you your best friend. 
<<next 2s t8n>>"What is going on with you, did your mom finally cave and buy something from that shop at the mall? You look so stunning!!"

"Ugh, I don't know, I feel so silly! I'm not used to wearing something so attention grabbing."

<<timed 2s t8n>> You fumble around with the lock on your locker. 

<<next 2s t8n>> "Maybe I should change into that extra outfit I keep in here..."

As your day goes on, you start to calm down a bit.

<<timed 2s t8n>> In fact, dressing up for school kinda makes things more fun! You even got a few compliments!

<<next 2s t8n>> Walking into fourth period, you feel like this might be shaping up to be a pretty good day!

<<next 2s t8n>> [[That is until|until]]

!"Hey you!"

<<timed 2s t8n>> There's a guy staring straight at you.
<<next 2s t8n>> He's pretty popular and is alwayyssss talking, you've had a lot of classes with him.
<<next 2s t8n>> Despite his loudness, you guys did a project together last year and he wasn't toooo bad. 

<<next 2s t8n>> "Uhhhh, whats up?"

<<next 2s t8n>> "Are you new? I've literally never seen you before."

<<next 2s t8n>> Wha..... what!!?? NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE!!?? 
I knew I didn't exactly stand out all the time, but this guys should DEFINETLY KNOW ME.

<<next 2s t8n>> "Ummmm, no I have this class with you every day."

<<next 2s t8n>>"Ohhhh my bad my bad. I guess I just never noticed you before.
Must be that weird fuckn' outfit, you trying to get my attention or something?"

"Uhhh, @@color:magenta;are you kidding me@@!!?? We literally did that huge group project together last year!
And absolutely no one is dressing up for your dumb ass! Don't speak like that to people like they don't matter, its rude!"

<<timed 3s t8n>> He immediatly goes red. "I... you're right. I'm sorry..."

<<next 3s t8n>>Well, that was awkward. But at least you stood up for yourself and you wont lie awake at night thinking about how to tell that asshole off.

You stare at each other for another second before he just shrugs and goes back to gabbing with his friends. 

<<timed 2s t8n>> What an asshole... do people not even know I exist!!

It's that time of day. 
<<timed 2s t8n>>You're so hungry you can't seem to focus on anything except that pb and j sandwhich waiting in your backpack. 

<<next 3s t8n>> Okay, not entirely true.

<<next 3s t8n>> You're thinkn' about that @@color:magenta;sandwhich@@ AND that @@color:magenta;special someone@@...

<<next 3s t8n>> Dispite your burning crush, you only ever sneeked looks at them during lunch and prayed they would make the first move.
<<next 3s t8n>> Looking at them now from across the cafetria you can't help but inwardly gush about the way their hair does that thing and ...

<<next 6s t8n>>!OH SHIT!! THE TOTALLY JUST CAUGHT US LOOKING!

<<timed 2s t8n>>Before looking away, you give a sweetest, @@color:magenta;most non threatening smile@@ you can muster. 
<<next 2s t8n>>What's the worst they can do right, ignore me?

<<next 2s t8n>> To your dismay, they smile back!!

<<next 2s t8n>>@@color:magenta;Ok the butterflies are for sure going crazy now@@, you cant get them to shut up for the rest of lunch.
